<section id="Introduction">
<h2> What Is Volleyball?</h2>
<p>The game of volleyball takes two forms: the <span id="Six">six-a-side indoor version, and beach volleyball.</span>The beach variety emerged on the Olympic scene at Atlanta in 1996 and is considered to be the more glamorous of the two versions – perhaps due in part to suntanned bodies and the skimpy clothing worn by competitors! <br>
However, in both disciplines the object of the game is the same: to get the ball to land in the opposition’s half of the court.

<section id="History">
<h2>The History of Volleyball
    </h2>
<p>The game of volleyball goes back as far as 1895, when it was invented in America as a hybrid of tennis and basketball. It spread to Europe and around the world during World War I, and became an officially recognised sport after World War II, when the International Federation was founded. Having been played as a demonstration sport at the 1924 Olympics, it was finally granted full status at the 1964 Tokyo Games – when both men and women started competing at the same time.

<br>The good thing about volleyball is that it can be played both indoors and out. Rather confusingly, however, the distinction between the six-a-side and the beach versions – one as an indoor sport and the other as an outdoor sport – is becoming blurred, with some people even playing indoor sand volleyball – which takes the beach version indoors, so it can be played whatever the weather.</p>

<section id="Positions">
    <h2> Poisitons</h2>
    <h3> - Setter, right front</h3>
    <p>The setter is, in general, a volleyball position where the player is a leader on the court on terms of flow of play.<br>The setter usually receives the ball via a “pass” (i.e. the first touch) in order to have the second touch of the ball. The setter’s main responsibility on offense is to place the ball in the air well for the third touch by their attacking fellow teammate.

    <h3>- Outside Hitter, left front
    </h3>
    <p> The outside hitter is the primary attacker on the team that's usually at the top left corner of the court. <br>This player often attacking the ball on the third touch from the setter before the ball’s trajectory reaches the peak of its arc.
    </p>

    <h3>- Middle Blocker, middle front </h3>
    <p>The middle blocker is usually the tallest person on the team, this person moves around the front line, defensively blocking almost every hit. Middle blocker also attacks from the middle front zone of the court.
    </p>

    <h3>- Libero, middle back</h3>
    <p>The libero plays a special role in team defense and stands out on the court, usually wearing an opposite colored jersey. Playing only the three back row positions before substituting back to the bench, the agile libero handles shots from the other team.<br> The libero is the digging and passing specialist, he or she controls the ball back to setters and hitters. The libero rarely comes close to the net and is usually the shortest player on the team.

<section id="Rules">
<h2>How to Play Volleyball</h2>
<h3>-Basic Rules</h3>
    <p>Two teams, consisting of 6 players each, oppose each other in a defined-boundary court that is divided equally by a net. The object of the game is to hit an inflated ball over the net into the opposing team’s side of the court in a “rally”, such that the ball is “grounded” (i.e. it touches the court surface within the opposing team’s court boundary) or otherwise cannot be returned back over the net to the other team’s court on the opposite side of the net.
    <img id=hihi  src="https://villataina-pfmwv1vqf2or.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/voll2.gif" height="300px" width="500px">
    <br>Each team is allowed to touch the ball up to 3 times on its own side during a rally, with the third touch having to be the one getting the ball back over the net (if the previous two touches did not do so). The team that gets the ball over the net to the opposing side, such that it cannot be returned (via grounding or an inability to return the ball within three touches) is awarded a point.
    </p>
<h3>-Court Layout</h3>
     <img id=hihi src="http://www.volleyballadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Volleyball-Court-Layout-1.jpg" height="250px" width="500px">
    <p>The volleyball court itself has a standard dimension of 18 meters by 9 meters, and has named lines to mark the various important portions of the court itself. The color of the court will vary from venue to venue, but you can count on seeing the following:<br><br>
        
    <span id="Seven"> Center Line</span> – a line marking the exact middle of the court, located directly under the net, separating the opposing sides
        
    <br><br> <span id="Seven">Sideline</span> – the outer boundary of the court along its length
    End line (or Baseline) – the outer boundary of the court along its width
        
    <br><br> <span id="Seven">Attack Line</span>– also known as the “3 meter line”, it separates the frontcourt from the backcourt and is important in the rules of volleyball in terms of which players can “attack” or hit the ball over the net (more on that later)

    <br><br> <span id="Seven">Free Zone</span> – usually a 3 meter-wide area surrounding the entire court in which the ball can be played during a rally.

    <br> <br><span id="Seven">Backcourt</span> – the area of the court behind the attack line

    <br><br> <span id="Seven">Frontcourt</span> – the area of the court in front of the attack line
    </p>
    <h3>-Rotation</h3>
    <p>
    All six players, no matter what their skills or positional offense and defense roles, must follow a strict pattern of set up after their team gets the ball back for service (called a side-out).
    </p>
    <img id=hihi src="http://www.volleyballadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Volleyball-Rotations-Explained.jpg" height="350px" width="500px">
    <p>It is critical to understand that once the ball is served, the setter (and the rest of the players as well) may move to their assigned role spots on the court surface, with the following caveat: players who started in the back row on the serve may NOT attack the ball in the front row. If they do become involved in an attack, they have to have started the attack BEHIND the attack line </p>
